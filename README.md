# 🛡️ Cloud Security Monitoring & Automation Platform


🚀 Project Overview

Build a security monitoring platform using AWS services and automation to detect, alert, and respond to security incidents in a cloud environment.

🔑 Key Features

Threat Detection & Monitoring:

- Use AWS CloudTrail, Amazon GuardDuty, and AWS Security Hub to monitor for unusual activity.

- Set up Amazon CloudWatch alarms and custom metrics for real-time security insights.

Automation & Incident Response:

- Automate threat response with AWS Lambda and AWS Step Functions.

- Use AWS Systems Manager to run automated remediation scripts.

Infrastructure as Code:

- Deploy resources securely with Terraform, emphasizing least privilege and secure configurations.

Network Security:

- Implement VPC Security Groups, Network ACLs, and AWS WAF to protect web applications.

Compliance & Governance:

- Set up AWS Config rules to ensure compliance with best practices (e.g., CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark).

💡 Tech Stack


Backend: AWS Lambda, Python for automation scripts.

Frontend: React for a security dashboard with Amazon QuickSight integration for analytics.

Automation: CI/CD with GitHub Actions.

Monitoring: AWS CloudWatch, GuardDuty, Security Hub.

# AWS Security Platform Implementation

## 1. Set Up AWS Environment
- Create an AWS account if not already available.
- Configure IAM roles and policies for least privilege access.
- Set up VPC, subnets, security groups, and Network ACLs.

### 1.1 Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Using Terraform for infrastructure provisioning:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

resource "aws_subnet" "subnet" {
  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block = "10.0.1.0/24"
  availability_zone = "us-west-2a"
}
```

## 2. Implement Threat Detection & Monitoring
- Enable AWS CloudTrail for activity logging.
- Activate Amazon GuardDuty for threat detection.
- Configure AWS Security Hub for centralized security findings.
- Set up CloudWatch alarms and custom metrics for monitoring.

### 2.1 CloudTrail & GuardDuty Setup
```bash
aws cloudtrail create-trail --name MyTrail --s3-bucket-name my-bucket
aws guardduty create-detector --enable
```

## 3. Develop Automation & Incident Response
- Create AWS Lambda functions for automated responses.
- Use AWS Step Functions to orchestrate security workflows.
- Implement AWS Systems Manager for automated remediation scripts.

### 3.1 Lambda Function Example
```python
import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Example auto-remediation
    print("Received event: " + json.dumps(event, indent=2))
    return {'statusCode': 200, 'body': json.dumps('Function executed successfully!')}
```

## 4. Build the React Frontend
- Set up a React project using Vite or Create React App.
- Integrate Amazon QuickSight for security analytics.
- Fetch and display security data from AWS services.

### 4.1 Sample React Code
```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

const SecurityData = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/security-data')
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((data) => setData(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Security Data</h1>
      <ul>
        {data.map((item, index) => (
          <li key={index}>{item.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default SecurityData;
```

## 5. Implement CI/CD Pipeline
- Use GitHub Actions for automated deployments.
- Set up testing and security scanning in the pipeline.

### 5.1 GitHub Actions Sample
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '16'
    - run: npm install
    - run: npm run build
    - name: Deploy to AWS
      run: npm run deploy
```

## 6. Ensure Compliance & Governance
- Configure AWS Config rules to enforce security best practices.
- Regularly audit logs and security findings.
- Implement reporting and alerting mechanisms.

## 7. Testing & Optimization
- Perform security tests using AWS Inspector and penetration testing tools.
- Optimize Lambda function performance and costs.
- Fine-tune alert thresholds and automation workflows.

## 8. Deploy & Maintain
- Deploy the platform and monitor performance.
- Regularly update security rules and automation logic.
- Continuously improve the platform based on security insights.
